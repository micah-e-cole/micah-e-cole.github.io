I have a passion for turning complexity into clarity. As a technically-minded analyst and communicator, I operate at the intersection of data, systems, engineering, and process. My approach is to:

Analyze: Dive into data with Power BI, SQL, and Python to uncover insights and build dashboards that drive strategic decisions.

Document: Create comprehensive documentation using a 'Docs as Code' methodology with Jekyll, Markdown, and GitHub (where adopted) and to ensure clarity, consistency, and knowledge retention throughout the documentation process.

Improve: Engineer automation and process improvements with Python, VBA, JavaSCript, and PowerQuery to eliminate manual work, boost efficiency, and increase reliability.

Support: Serve as the expert liaison between technical and non-technical users, translating complex issues into clear, actionable solutions.
