### TPMS/BTLE Application (Swift, iOS)

#### Background
As a user of a manual wheelchair, I wanted to create a project that would serve as both an educational endeavor and also as a means to provide means for myself (and hopefully others, too) to have increased quality of life through the use of this project. My project was devised from the constant need to check the tire pressure on my wheelchair and this process being cumbersome (requiring an air refill whenever the pressure is checked due to air escaping in the process). I knew that several companies have created pressure gauges for automobiles and bikes which include pressure sensors on an end-cap that is threaded onto the existing tire and many of these sensors have Bluetooth low-energy (BTLE) capabilities (enabling the sensors to send data directly to the user). Several companies provide an app that accompanies a proprietary sensor but they require monthly subscription payments to use the app which is prohibitive for many individuals with this need. I decided, then that I would like to create a means of interfacing with the sensor and to then provide the data directly to an app of my own with the end-goal being receiving the data directly to my smartwatch where I can check the pressure.
#### Development
This project is actively under development, the first stage being learning Swift and working in Xcode. I will continue to document my progress on this page. Stay tuned!
