## Record Cabinet Design and Build

This project combined traditional woodworking craftsmanship with modern design principles to produce a **mid-century-inspired record cabinet** — built from beautiful walnut, engineered for strength, proportion, and functional beauty.

---

### Design Objectives

The piece was designed to **complement vintage stereo equipment** while maintaining a minimal, timeless aesthetic.  
Key goals included:

- Housing a turntable, amplifier, and record collection within a clean profile  
- Concealing cables and components while keeping everything accessible  
- Maintaining durability through solid joinery and high-tolerance fitting  

---

### Material Selection and Preparation

- **Wood species:** Selected walnut for its tonal richness and dimensional stability.  
- **Panel construction:** Used book-matched boards for visual symmetry across cabinet doors.  
- **Joinery:** Employed dowel and rabbet joints for strength and clean internal geometry.  
- **Surface prep:** Sanded progressively from 80-grit to 320-grit for glass-smooth finishing.

### Design Process

1. **Conceptual Modeling** – Created a digital model using [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/){:target="_blank"} to finalize internal clearances and optimize material yield.  
2. **Dimensional Planning** – Designed compartments sized for 12-inch LPs, with additional ventilation clearance for the amplifier bay.  
3. **Cut List Automation** – Exported optimized panel dimensions to reduce waste from each board foot.

### Fabrication and Assembly

- Cut and joined side panels using precision guides and a custom fence jig.  
- Built removable back panels for wiring access.  
- Installed vibration-isolating rubber feet and cushioned turntable mount points.  
- Aligned the face frame and flush doors with rare-earth magnetic catches for a seamless appearance.  

---

### Finishing

- Applied Danish oil followed by hand-rubbed polyurethane for a satin-sheen protective finish.  
- Final buffing with 0000 steel wool enhanced depth and tactile warmth.  
- Added brass hardware for subtle contrast against the dark walnut tone.  

---

### Skills Demonstrated

- Furniture design and dimensional planning  
- Joinery and jig fabrication for precision woodworking  
- CAD modeling and cut-list optimization  
- Surface finishing and hardware integration  
- Problem-solving through iterative prototyping and fit testing
