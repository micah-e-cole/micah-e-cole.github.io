## Mid-Century Modern Record Cabinet

This project blends **functional design and craftsmanship** to create a **mid-century-inspired record cabinet** that serves as both a piece of furniture and a sculptural artwork.  
Built from **American Walnut**, the cabinet unites precision joinery, thoughtful ergonomics, and aesthetic balance — designed to house a vinyl collection and turntable while elevating the visual harmony of a living space.

---

### Design Concept

The record cabinet was envisioned as a **functional centerpiece**, combining storage and art in one cohesive form.  
Its proportions and surface geometry were refined to maintain a low, balanced stance — allowing the piece to integrate naturally with vintage stereo components and contemporary interiors alike.

**Key objectives:**
- Accommodate turntable, amplifier, and vinyl collection in an intuitive layout  
- Employ sustainable hardwood and enduring joinery techniques  
- Achieve visual lightness through curved elements and open shadow lines  
- Design an heirloom-quality object that stands as both functional and artistic  

---

### Material Selection

- **Wood Species:** *American Walnut* — chosen for its warmth, dimensional stability, and natural chatoyance that deepens over time.  
- **Hardware:** Brass accent pulls and concealed rare-earth magnetic catches for minimalist detailing.  
- **Sliding Doors:** Designed and fabricated **tambour-style doors** from continuous walnut slats — allowing seamless curvature and motion while visually tying the entire facade together.

### Design & Build Process

1. **Digital Planning** – Modeled the cabinet in [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/){:target="_blank"} to finalize internal dimensions and tambour track geometry.  
2. **Joinery Precision** – Utilized dowel joinery for invisible reinforcement and square alignment of frame members.  
3. **Tambour Fabrication** – Routed slat edges and applied canvas backing to enable flexible, smooth door operation within curved tracks.  
4. **Assembly** – Built the carcass with inset base supports for weight distribution and floated back panels for expansion control.  
5. **Finishing Touches** – Added vibration-damping isolation feet and hidden cable routing for audio components.

### Surface Finishing

- Applied clear lacquer for natural color enhancement  
- Hand-rubbed finish for a satin, durable finish  
- Final polishing with fine cloth for soft, tactile sheen  

---

### Design Philosophy

The cabinet embodies **functional minimalism** — a union of utility and aesthetic restraint.  
Its design language draws from mid-century modern principles: *clean lines, honest materials, and a celebration of form following function.*
