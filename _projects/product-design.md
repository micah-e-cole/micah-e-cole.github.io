### Furniture Design

# Behind the Design

I encountered numerous advertisements for a specific bed frame online and while I do love the look of this frame (hint, you have probably also had this advertised to you as well) I did not want to pay the steep sticker price for one of these beds. 

After researching pictures, videos, and forums where other carpenters discussed their own thoughts/designs for this project, I drew up this design according to the size specifications that would fit a Queen-size mattress. 

While I have yet to build this project in the shop, I am very pleased with how it turned out and hope it can prove useful to others who may be interested in building their own. The files (the Sketchup file and cut list spreadsheet) are avaailable on my [GitHub](https://github.com/micah-e-cole/Bed_Frame).
