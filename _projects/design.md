## UX/UI Design
For a course in User Experience Design, I learned how to use the prototyping tool, Figma, to design a website for the fictional island of Taniti. Designs were determined using user research (both written and solicited) as well as course materials for required elements.
### Interactive Prototype

### Special Features

A component of particular significance with this project was the use of prototyping features and overlays within the design to create the look and feel of an interactive map (similar to Google Maps, etc). This enabled the fictional island to have a map with fictional businesses and to show where they were located on the island as well as pertinent details about them.
