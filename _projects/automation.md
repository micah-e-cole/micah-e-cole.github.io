## Automation
In an ongoing learning, I have been working on learning tools for Network and IT Security. One tool I found difficult to obtain in my own case (using Kali Linux on a VM) was Linux tools to directly read/translate wtmp logs for DFIR. I have been working on creating a C/C++ user-interface that can do this quickly using imgui and will be continuing to post updates as I make progress.
