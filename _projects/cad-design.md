## Behind the Design

After encountering frequent online ads for a popular bed frame, I saw an opportunity to recreate a similar product at a fraction of the cost. I independently researched the frame by analyzing reference images, user videos, and online forums where professional carpenters shared build strategies and challenges.

I translated these insights into a custom design tailored to a Queen-size mattress, drafting a detailed model in SketchUp and creating a corresponding cut list in a spreadsheet format. While the physical build is pending, I documented the entire design process and made the files publicly available on GitHub to support other DIY builders.

This project reflects my ability to:

- Rapidly learn new technical skills through self-directed research
- Convert conceptual designs into precise technical documentation
- Communicate complex ideas clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Share knowledge and contribute to the open-source maker community
