## Soundwave Art Installation

I conceptualized, designed, and built a large-format, wall-mounted wood art installation from scratch, translating a digital soundwave into a physical piece using hand-selected materials and custom tooling solutions.


#### Process Overview

- User-Centered Design: The piece was created with specific dimensions (3’ x 6’) to meet space constraints, and the soundwave featured a meaningful phrase selected for emotional resonance—anchoring the work in user-centered principles.
- Material Selection: Chose Alder wood for its regional relevance (native to the Pacific Northwest), moderate weight (important for wall-mounting), and strong workability—balancing aesthetics, function, and material science.
- Digital-to-Physical Translation:
  - Captured and isolated audio using [Audacity®](https://www.audacityteam.org/){:target="_blank"}.
  - Exported soundwave as a scalable PNG using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"} 
  - Converted to a full-size physical template using large-format printing
- Tool Customization: Designed and fabricated a custom zero-clearance insert and hold-down jig for the table saw using phenolic resin and a router to enable safe, consistent cutting of 1/8" wood strips—demonstrating tool adaptation and process optimization.
- Staged Build Process:
  - Glued and planed panels for the base
  - Aligned thin strips over the template to form the waveform
  - Used fast-setting adhesives, sanding, and sectional glue-ups to ensure precision and finish quality
- Aesthetic Finishing:
  - Applied layered gradient stain using MIXOL® pigments with denatured alcohol
  - Sealed the piece with polycrylic, then hand-buffed with Scotch-Brite for a high-gloss finish
    
Skills Demonstrated:
  - End-to-end project planning & execution
  - Tool customization & hands-on problem-solving
  - Strong visual communication & technical documentation
  - Translating abstract digital inputs into high-fidelity physical output
  - Focus on user/audience experience and design resonance
