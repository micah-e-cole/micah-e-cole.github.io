#### Project Overview
 [This](https://micah-e-cole.github.io/wordApp/){:target="_blank"} browser-based word guessing game was built as part of my learning journey in JavaScript and front-end development. The goal was to create a simple but engaging interactive experience that could be played entirely in the browser without requiring external libraries or frameworks—solidifying my understanding of DOM manipulation, game logic, and user interface design.

I wanted to reinforce core JavaScript concepts through a project that required real-time user interaction, conditional logic, and dynamic content updates. Word games offer a familiar yet adaptable framework to explore these skills, especially when layered with progressive difficulty and responsive feedback.

#### Difficulty-Based Word Selection:
- Users begin by selecting a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard). The game filters from predefined word banks to randomly select a word that matches the chosen challenge.

#### Core Game Logic:
- JavaScript tracks player input via keypress events
- Correct guesses reveal letters in-place; incorrect guesses are counted
- Win/loss conditions are tracked and displayed with real-time feedback

#### Interactive UI Design:
- Built a clean and accessible interface using CSS Flexbox to center game content, highlight active states, and provide smooth transitions during gameplay.

#### Browser Compatibility & Deployment:
- The app is fully functional in modern browsers and is currently hosted on GitHub Pages for public access and feedback.

#### Future Development
###### Enhanced Word Randomization:
- I plan to migrate the app to a full-stack environment to allow dynamic word list updates and scraping from external sources.

###### User Data and Stats:
- Incorporate localStorage or server-side persistence to track scores and user progress over time.

###### Mobile Optimization:
- Further refine the layout and interaction model to provide an optimal experience on smaller screens and touch interfaces.
