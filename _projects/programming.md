## Word Guessing Game (HTML,CSS,JavaScript)

As a part of a course in JavaScript, I developed a simple web app to enable users to play a word-guessing game. The game prompts the user for their difficulty selection, and based upon their choices selects (from a list of random words) the appropriate word.

In the future, I would like to host the app outside of the confines of GitHub's static pages environment so as to enable the word scraping and randomization of the game to be enabled. If you would like to give the game a try, head on over [here](https://micah-e-cole.github.io/wordApp/){:target="_blank"}.
